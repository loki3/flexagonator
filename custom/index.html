  <h1>Custom flexagonator pages</h1>

  <p>
    The following list describes custom pages built on top of the <i>flexagonator</i> toolkit aimed at
    different techniques and tools for working with flexagons and flexes.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="../index.html">../index.html</a>: General purpose UI for creating custom flexagons, applying arbitrary
      flex sequences, working with an interactive flexagon, creating templates, and running custom scripts.</li>
    <li><a href="atomic.html">atomic.html</a>: UI for applying atomic flexes on atomic pat structure. Includes the
      atomic definitions of a wide variety of flexes, including morph flexes.</li>
    <li><a href="bracelet.html">bracelet.html</a>: UI for experimenting with running cycles of flex sequences on silver
      bracelets.</li>
    <li><a href="by-name.html">by-name.html</a>: Categorizing and naming flexagons based on properties such as leaf
      shape, pat, and overall shape.</li>
    <li><a href="ennea-flip.html">ennea-flip.html</a>: UI for playing with cycles of F and F3 on an
      <i>enneaflexagon (generator: (F+&lt;&lt;&lt;)3)</i>.
    </li>
    <li><a href="explore.html">explore.html</a>: A tool for exploring all the states of a flexagon accessible from a
      given set of flexes. Includes options for traversing and displaying the resulting graph.</li>
    <li><a href="generator.html">generator.html</a>: Pared down interface for creating flexagons from a generating
      sequence and exploring the results.</li>
    <li><a href="hexa.html">hexa.html</a>: Options for creating all the standard hexaflexagons with 3 to 8 faces by
      using generating sequences of pinch flexes. As you pinch flex around the interactive flexagon, it tracks where you
      are in the graph of pinch states.</li>
    <li><a href="infinity.html">infinity.html</a>: Let's you easily create arbitrarily nested flexagons by providing
      buttons that generate the necessary pat structure for carrying out any prime flex. Interpolates face numbers and
      colors as it adds nested structure.</li>
    <li><a href="minimal.html">minimal.html</a>: Options for seeing the minimal flexagons for some of the basic flexes.
    </li>
    <li><a href="morph-flexes.html">morph-flexes.html</a>: Shows how composing the morph-kite flexes are equivalent to
      sequences of prime flexes such as the pinch, tuck, flip, and pyramid shuffle. There are options for
      seeing the templates for the minimal flexagon for the morph-kite flexes.</li>
    <li><a href="multi-strip.html">multi-strip.html</a>: A tool for splitting a template into multiple pieces,
      useful if it overlaps itself or if you want to break it into more manageable pieces.</li>
    <li><a href="rule110.html">rule110.html</a>: Runs the 1D cellular automaton
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">Rule 110</a> on a flexagon
    </li>
  </ul>
