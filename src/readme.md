# Flexagonator source code

* [analyze](analyze): Routines for analyzing flexes on flexagons,
  including exploring the states reachable by a set of flexes,
  creating and working with the graph of flexes and states,
  comparing flex sequences, and investigating subgroups.
* [atomic](atomic): Code for working with low-level [atomic flex theory](../docs/atomic-theory.md).
  See [Applying atomic flexes](../custom/atomic.html) for a sample interface.
* [draw](draw): Functions that draw flexagons, templates, and graphs.
* [flex](flex): The core routines for manipulating flexes by applying various flexes.
* [geometry](geometry): General geometry utilities.
